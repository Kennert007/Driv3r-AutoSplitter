# Known issues

If you have already loaded into a map then exited into the main menu and started a new game then it will split right at the start.

It will double-split at the start of The Chase.

It will split after the train section when loading into the shooting section in Chase the Train.

It can very rarely double-split after seemingly random maps.


# Other

This is a very basic autosplitter which i quickly threw together when i was running the game so it can only split right now.
